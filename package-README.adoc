= bespoke-overview

This plugin adds an overview mode to your http://markdalgleish.com/projects/bespoke.js[Bespoke] presentation.
You activate overview mode by pressing the `o` key.
In this mode, all slides become visible and are arranged on a grid.
In addition to providing a “big picture” view of your presentation, you can also use this mode as a navigation aid to quickly jump to an arbitrary slide.

== Usage

This plugin is shipped in a https://github.com/umdjs/umd[UMD format], meaning it is available as a CommonJS/AMD module or as a browser global.

For example, when using CommonJS modules:

```js
var bespoke = require('bespoke'),
  classes = require('bespoke-classes'),
  keys = require('bespoke-keys'),
  overview = require('bespoke-overview');

bespoke.from('.deck', [
  classes(),
  keys(),
  overview()
]);
```

When using browser globals:

```js
bespoke.from('.deck', [
  bespoke.plugins.classes(),
  bespoke.plugins.keys(),
  bespoke.plugins.overview()
]);
```

For more information about options, styling and how the plugin works, see the https://github.com/opendevise/bespoke-overview/blob/master/README.adoc[complete README] on GitHub.
